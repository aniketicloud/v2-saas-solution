# Organization Deletion Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive multi-step organization deletion feature for the admin portal with confirmation workflow, detailed information display, and proper cleanup.

## Implementation Date
October 17, 2025

## Features Implemented

### 1. Multi-Step Confirmation Flow
- **Step 1: Review & Warning**
  - Display organization information (name, slug, members, teams, invitations)
  - Show impact warning with detailed breakdown
  - Visual statistics display with icons
  - Clear warning about permanent deletion
  
- **Step 2: Final Confirmation**
  - Require typing exact organization name to confirm
  - Real-time validation of confirmation text
  - Final review of organization being deleted
  - Disabled delete button until correct confirmation

### 2. Separate Delete Page
- **Route**: `/admin/organizations/[id]/delete`
- **Components**:
  - `page.tsx` - Main delete page with server-side data fetching
  - `loading.tsx` - Loading state with skeletons
  - `_components/delete-organization-form.tsx` - Multi-step form component

### 3. Data Display Before Deletion
Shows the following organization information:
- Organization name and slug
- Member count
- Team count  
- Pending invitations count
- Creation date
- Visual statistics with icons for better UX

### 4. Success Toast & Redirect
- Success toast shows:
  - Organization name that was deleted
  - Organization slug
  - Number of members affected
- Automatically redirects to organization list page
- Refreshes router to update data

### 5. Delete Implementation
- Uses Better Auth's `auth.api.deleteOrganization()` API
- Automatically handles cascading deletes:
  - Organization members
  - Teams
  - Invitations
  - Organization metadata
- Validates organization ID
- Fetches organization details before deletion for success message
- Proper error handling with tryCatch utility

### 6. Access Points
Multiple ways to access delete functionality:
1. **Organization Detail Page**: Delete button in header next to Edit button
2. **Organization Card**: Dropdown menu with Delete option
3. **Direct URL**: `/admin/organizations/[id]/delete`

## File Structure

```
app/(admin)/admin/organizations/
├── [id]/
│   ├── delete/
│   │   ├── page.tsx                    # Delete page (server component)
│   │   ├── loading.tsx                 # Loading state
│   │   └── _components/
│   │       └── delete-organization-form.tsx  # Multi-step form
│   └── page.tsx                        # Detail page (added delete button)
├── _components/
│   └── OrganizationCard.tsx            # Card with dropdown menu
└── _lib/
    └── actions.ts                      # Server action with deleteOrganization
```

## Server Action: `deleteOrganization`

### Function Signature
```typescript
export async function deleteOrganization(id: string): Promise<{
  success: boolean;
  data?: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    slug: string;
    deletedCounts: {
      members: number;
      teams: number;
      invitations: number;
    };
  };
  error?: string;
}>
```

### Implementation Details
1. Validates organization ID
2. Fetches organization details (for success message)

4. Returns organization info with deleted counts
5. Proper error handling with tryCatch

## Future Improvements (TODO Comments Added)

The following improvements are documented in code comments for future implementation:

### 1. Soft Delete with Grace Period
```typescript
// TODO: Implement soft delete with grace period (30 days before permanent deletion)
```
- Add `deletedAt` timestamp to organization schema
- Create scheduled job to permanently delete after grace period
- Add "Restore Organization" functionality during grace period
- Filter out soft-deleted orgs from lists

### 2. Email Notifications
```typescript
// TODO: Send email notifications to all affected members
```
- Notify all members when organization is deleted
- Include organization details and deletion date
- Provide admin contact for questions
- Add email template for deletion notifications

### 3. Audit Trail
```typescript
// TODO: Add audit trail logging for compliance
```
- Log who deleted the organization and when
- Track what data was deleted
- Store audit logs for compliance requirements
- Add audit log viewer in admin portal

### 4. Data Export
```typescript
// TODO: Allow data export before deletion
```
- Generate CSV/JSON export of organization data
- Include members, teams, and metadata
- Automatic email with export file
- Archive exports for compliance

### 5. Subscription Checks
```typescript
// TODO: Check for active subscriptions/billing before allowing deletion
```
- Prevent deletion if active subscription exists
- Show billing status in delete confirmation
- Require canceling subscription first
- Handle refunds/credits appropriately

### 6. Ownership Transfer
```typescript
// TODO: Add option to transfer ownership instead of deleting
```

## Testing Checklist
