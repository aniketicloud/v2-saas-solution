# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the v2-saas-solution project.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs help teams:

- üìö **Document why** decisions were made, not just what was decided
- üß≠ **Guide future developers** who need to understand the system
- üîç **Preserve context** that might otherwise be lost
- ü§ù **Facilitate discussions** about architecture changes
- üìà **Track evolution** of the system over time

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

1. **Title**: Short noun phrase (e.g., "ADR-001: Organizations Module Restructuring")
2. **Status**: Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded
3. **Context**: What problem are we solving? Why now?
4. **Decision**: What did we decide to do?
5. **Consequences**: What are the positive and negative outcomes?
6. **Alternatives**: What other options did we consider?

## ADR Index

| ADR | Title | Status | Date |
|-----|-------|--------|------|
| [ADR-001](./ADR-001-admin-organizations-restructuring.md) | Admin Organizations Module Restructuring | Accepted | 2025-10-16 |
| [ADR-002](./ADR-002-admin-portal-home-navigation.md) | Admin Portal Home and Breadcrumb Navigation | Accepted | 2025-10-16 |

## Creating a New ADR

When making significant architectural changes:

1. **Copy the template** (or reference ADR-001)
2. **Number sequentially** (ADR-002, ADR-003, etc.)
3. **Use descriptive titles** (kebab-case)
4. **Fill in all sections** (context, decision, consequences)
5. **Link related ADRs** in "Related Decisions"
6. **Update this README** with the new entry

## When to Write an ADR

Write an ADR when:

- ‚úÖ Changing major folder structure or module organization
- ‚úÖ Adopting new libraries, frameworks, or tools
- ‚úÖ Establishing new patterns or conventions
- ‚úÖ Making trade-offs between alternatives
- ‚úÖ Decisions that affect multiple teams or modules
- ‚úÖ Breaking changes that need justification

Don't write an ADR for:

- ‚ùå Minor refactoring within a single component
- ‚ùå Bug fixes that don't change architecture
- ‚ùå Routine feature additions following existing patterns
- ‚ùå Configuration changes
