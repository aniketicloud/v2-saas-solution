# Organization Route Error Handling - Fix Summary

**Date**: January 2025  
**Issue**: New users accessing organization routes caused Next.js errors and server crashes  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

## Problem Description

### What Happened

When a new user (not a member of any organization) tried to access an organization route like:
```
http://localhost:3000/org/nkjad/teams
```

**Result**:
- ❌ Next.js error: "Organization not found"
- ❌ Server broke/crashed
- ❌ Poor user experience
- ❌ No graceful error handling

### Root Causes

1. **No try-catch around organization fetch**
   - `auth.api.getFullOrganization()` could throw errors
   - Errors were unhandled, causing server crashes

2. **Poor error messages**
   - Generic "not found" page didn't explain why
   - Users didn't know if slug was wrong or they lacked access

3. **No error boundary**
   - Unexpected errors would crash the entire route
   - No recovery mechanism

---

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Added Try-Catch Error Handling ✅

**File**: `app/(organization)/org/[slug]/layout.tsx`

**Before** (Dangerous):
```tsx
// Could throw unhandled errors
const organization = await auth.api.getFullOrganization({
  query: { organizationSlug: params.slug },
  headers: await headers(),
});
```

**After** (Safe - Using tryCatch Utility):
```tsx
// Fetch organization by slug with error handling
const [organization, error] = await tryCatch(
  auth.api.getFullOrganization({
    query: { organizationSlug: params.slug },
    headers: await headers(),
  })
);

// If there's an error fetching the organization, show not found
if (error) {
  console.error("Error fetching organization:", error);
  notFound();
}

// Handle case where organization is not found
if (!organization) {
  notFound();
}
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Uses project's tryCatch utility for consistency
- ✅ Cleaner, more linear code flow (no nested blocks)
- ✅ Go-style error handling with tuple destructuring
- ✅ Catches all fetch errors
- ✅ Logs errors for debugging
- ✅ Shows user-friendly not-found page
- ✅ Prevents server crashes

---

### 2. Improved Not-Found Page ✅

**File**: `app/(organization)/org/[slug]/not-found.tsx`

**Before**: Generic error message

**After**: Helpful, informative error page with:
- Clear heading: "Organization Not Found"
- Detailed explanation of possible reasons:
  - ✅ Incorrect or misspelled slug
  - ✅ Organization has been deleted
  - ✅ User is not a member
  - ✅ User hasn't been invited to any organizations
- Action buttons:
  - "Sign Out" - Clear session and start over
  - "Go to Dashboard" - Navigate to main area
- Help text: "Contact your organization administrator"

**Design**:
- Uses shadcn/ui components for consistency
- Muted background colors
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Accessible and responsive

---

### 3. Added Error Boundary ✅

**File**: `app/(organization)/org/[slug]/error.tsx` (NEW)

**Purpose**: Catch unexpected runtime errors in organization routes

**Features**:
- ✅ Displays error message in user-friendly format
- ✅ Shows error ID (digest) for debugging
- ✅ Logs error to console
- ✅ Provides "Try Again" button to retry
- ✅ Provides "Go to Dashboard" escape route
- ✅ Client-side error boundary (Next.js 15 pattern)

**Example Error Display**:
```
Something Went Wrong
We encountered an error while loading this organization.

Error Details:
Failed to fetch organization: Network error

Error ID: abc123xyz

[Go to Dashboard] [Try Again]
```

## User Flow Examples

### Scenario 1: New User Visits Invalid Org

**Action**: New user navigates to `/org/invalid-slug/teams`

**Flow**:
1. Middleware validates session ✅
2. Layout checks authentication ✅
3. Try to fetch organization "invalid-slug"
4. Organization not found → `notFound()` called
5. User sees **not-found page** with helpful message
6. User clicks "Go to Dashboard"
7. Dashboard redirects to `/no-organization` (user has no orgs)
8. User sees clear message about needing organization membership

**Result**: ✅ Graceful handling, clear messaging, no crashes

---

### Scenario 2: User Not a Member

**Action**: Regular user tries to access `/org/company-xyz/teams`

**Flow**:
1. Middleware validates session ✅
2. Layout checks authentication ✅
3. Fetch organization "company-xyz" ✅
4. Check membership → User is NOT a member
5. Redirect to `/unauthorized`
6. User sees unauthorized page explaining they need permission

**Result**: ✅ Clear access denied message, proper redirect

---

### Scenario 3: Network/Database Error

**Action**: User visits `/org/acme/teams` but database is down

**Flow**:
1. Middleware validates session ✅
2. Layout checks authentication ✅
3. Try to fetch organization → **Network error thrown**
4. Caught by try-catch → Logs error, calls `notFound()`
5. User sees not-found page (fallback for errors)
6. If error persists, error boundary catches it
7. User sees **error page** with retry option

**Result**: ✅ No server crash, user can retry or navigate away

---

### Scenario 4: Admin User

**Action**: Admin user tries to access `/org/any-org/teams`

**Flow**:
1. Middleware validates session ✅
2. Layout checks authentication ✅
3. Layout checks role: `session.user.role === "admin"`
4. Redirect to `/admin/dashboard`
5. Admin uses admin portal instead

**Result**: ✅ Admins stay in admin context, no org access needed

---

## Error Handling Layers

### Layer 1: Middleware
- Validates session exists and is valid
- Redirects to login if session invalid
- Clears invalid cookies

### Layer 2: Layout Authentication
- Checks user is authenticated
- Checks user role (admin vs regular)
- Redirects accordingly

### Layer 3: Organization Fetch (NEW)
- Try-catch around `getFullOrganization`
- Logs errors for debugging
- Shows not-found page on failure

### Layer 4: Membership Check
- Verifies user is member of organization
- Redirects to unauthorized if not member

### Layer 5: Error Boundary (NEW)
- Catches unexpected runtime errors
- Provides user-friendly error page
- Allows retry or navigation away

## Testing Scenarios

### ✅ Test 1: Invalid Org Slug
```bash
# Navigate to non-existent org
http://localhost:3000/org/doesnotexist/teams

# Expected:
# - See not-found page
# - No server crash
# - Can click "Go to Dashboard"
```

### ✅ Test 2: User Not Member
```bash
# Sign in as user@email.com (no orgs)
# Navigate to any org
http://localhost:3000/org/any-org/dashboard

# Expected:
# - See not-found page (org doesn't exist for them)
# - Or unauthorized page (if org exists but not member)
# - Can navigate away
```

### ✅ Test 3: Malformed Slug
```bash
# Navigate with special characters
http://localhost:3000/org/@#$%/teams

# Expected:
# - Handled gracefully
# - Not-found page shown
# - No server error
```

### ✅ Test 4: Admin Access
```bash
# Sign in as admin@email.com
# Try to access org route
http://localhost:3000/org/any-org/teams

# Expected:
# - Redirected to /admin/dashboard
# - Admins stay in admin context
```

### ✅ Test 5: Database Error Simulation
```bash
# Stop database
pnpm docker:down

# Navigate to org route
http://localhost:3000/org/test/teams

# Expected:
# - Error caught by try-catch
# - Not-found page or error boundary shown
# - No server crash
# - Error logged to console
```

## Best Practices Applied

### 1. Defense in Depth ✅
Multiple layers of error handling ensure robustness

### 2. Fail Gracefully ✅
Errors don't crash the server or show stack traces to users

### 3. Clear User Feedback ✅
Users understand what went wrong and what to do next

### 4. Proper Logging ✅
Errors are logged to console for debugging

### 5. Accessibility ✅
Error pages use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes

### 6. Consistent Design ✅
Error pages match the app's design system (shadcn/ui)

---

## Security Considerations

### ✅ No Information Leakage
- Error messages don't expose internal system details
- Database connection errors shown generically
- No stack traces exposed to users

### ✅ Access Control Maintained
- Even with errors, unauthorized users can't access orgs
- Membership checks still enforced
- Admin separation still maintained

### ✅ Session Validation
- Invalid sessions still cleared
- Protected routes still require auth
- No bypass through error paths

---

## Performance Impact

- ✅ **Minimal**: Try-catch has negligible performance cost
- ✅ **Better**: Prevents cascading errors and crashes
- ✅ **Improved**: Error boundaries prevent full page reloads

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Error Tracking Integration
```typescript
// Integrate with Sentry or similar
Sentry.captureException(error, {
  tags: {
    component: 'organization-layout',
    slug: params.slug,
  },
});
```

### 2. Retry with Exponential Backoff
```typescript
// Retry failed org fetches with backoff
const org = await fetchWithRetry(
  () => auth.api.getFullOrganization(...),
  { maxRetries: 3, backoff: true }
);
```

### 3. Offline Detection
```typescript
// Show different message if user is offline
if (!navigator.onLine) {
  return <OfflineMessage />;
}
```

### 4. Custom Error Types
```typescript
class OrganizationNotFoundError extends Error {}
class OrganizationAccessDeniedError extends Error {}

// Handle different error types differently
```
