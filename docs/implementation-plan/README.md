## 📋 Overview

This implementation plan documents the complete architecture for building a scalable multi-tenant SaaS application using Better Auth's organization plugin with custom extensions.

### Core Features

1. **Dual Role System**: System-level (admin/user) + Organization-level (owner/admin/member)
2. **Module System**: Feature flags for dynamic modules (visitors, tickets, inventory)
3. **Subscription Management**: Multi-tier plans (free/monthly/yearly)
4. **Smart Routing**: Context-aware navigation for system admins and org members
5. **Permission-Based Access Control**: Using Better Auth's AC (Access Control) system

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### System Admin vs Organization Admin

| Aspect | System Admin (User.role = "admin") | Org Admin (Member.role = "admin") |
|--------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Create Organizations | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Delete Organizations | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Manage Subscriptions | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Enable/Disable Modules | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Invite Members | ✅ Yes (as owner) | ✅ Yes |
| Manage Member Roles | ✅ Yes (as owner) | ✅ Yes |
| View Org Settings | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Edit Org Settings | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |

### Permission Flow

```
User Login
    ↓
Check User.role (system-level)
    ↓
    ├─→ "admin" → Admin Portal → Can access any org with full permissions
    └─→ "user" → Check activeOrganizationId
            ↓
        Get Member.role (org-level)
            ↓
            ├─→ "owner" → Full org permissions
            ├─→ "admin" → Limited org permissions
            └─→ "member" → Basic permissions
```
